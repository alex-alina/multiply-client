## Multiply - Client

WIP: This is the client for Multiply's landing page, a static page with a signup form that collects emails for a mailing list.

## Description

The goal of this project is to create a landing page for Multiply, a vector graphics project. 

Multiply lets designers quickly create variations of object designs, making them more efficient in creating repetitive patterns, a process that is now done by hand.

Multiply will be released as a plugin for Adobe Illustrator and Bohemian Sketch, and will integrate natively with the target software.
